Use it to get sound and light notifications of new posts, followers, votes and more!\n\nThe [previous released](https:\/\/hive.blog\/hive-139531\/@techtek\/blinkit-v3-2-or-blink-on-ocd-gems-splinterlands-and-other-community-activities-hive-nodes-setting-and-more) version 3.2 was about the first integration of communities, Hive node setting and few smaller changes.\n\n\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n## Latest release V3.3\n\nThis new release of Blinkit has the following new functions and changes:\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n\n\n### Blink your Smart home devices on Hive Blockchain interactions\n\nBlinkit now have support for Tasmota flashed, smart home devices, this includes the following brands:\n\n[Sonoff](https:\/\/sonoff.tech\/), Ohlux, Arlec, [Woox](https:\/\/wooxhome.com\/woox-m1), Koogeek, Swisstone, [Teckin](https:\/\/www.teckinhome.com\/), Sunco, Solimo, MoKo, some Philips devices and [and a ton](https:\/\/templates.blakadder.com\/all.html) of other brands and products.\n\n<br><\/br>\n\nThe devices used to integrate this new functionality in Blinkit are from LSC and can be bought in Europe for under 10 euro at one of the 1500+ [Action stores](https:\/\/www.action.com\/nl-nl\/winkels\/). \n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IQgprUl.jpg)\n*Tested with: LSC Smart Power plug and LSC Smart LED RGB (E14) bulb*\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cCvuCTi.png)\n*Compatible devices are cheap, a small selection of LSC branded devices sold at Action.* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n\nCheck this [device compatibility list](https:\/\/templates.blakadder.com\/) for a often updated overview of supported devices that can be flashed with the Tasmota Firmware many of them are available at Amazon and other webshops. (searching for \"tuya\" will show the re-branded products) \n\n\n<br><\/br>\n\nTasmota on github: https:\/\/tasmota.github.io\/docs\/\n\n(It is required to have this firmware on the device that you want to blink, but since the toggle address can be edited into any address, it could work with other smart home devices that can be toggled with a web request.)\n\nFor Tasmota device the toggle address is like below, but you have to change it with the blinkit ip settings button to the IP of your Tasmota device:\n\n`http:\/\/192.168.0.117\/cm?cmnd=Power%20TOGGLE`\n\n<br><\/br>\n\nTo get the Tasmota firmware on your smart home device you can use their [Windows tool](https:\/\/github.com\/tasmota\/tasmotizer), or the [Linux script](https:\/\/github.com\/tasmota\/tasmotizer) the process will take just a few minutes.\n\nThis will remove the default features and cloud functionality (The mobile Tuya app wont work anymore) on your wifi light bulb, or power socket etc, but you get a lot more features in return.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lkmNxI4.png)\n*Tasmota web interface on the LSC Smart Plug.* \n\n<br><\/br>\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uMH2JMZ.png)\n*Tasmota web interface on the LSC Smart LED RGB (E14) bulb.*\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LeTh1rT.png)\n*When Blinkit is started you can now select between two kinds of devices.*\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PbxlCFD.png)\n*The newly added Tasmota devices have the same functions that can trigger the light to blink, and slightly different settings.*\n<br><\/br>\n\n### Communities\n- Community functionality is improved, the Community can now be set to any community.\n\n- Community selection screen is now replaced by a function in the main window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n### Interface\n\n- After the splash screen is shown, the user can now choose a device to use, USB Flash drives, or the newly added Tasmota devices.\n\n- Smaller changes\n-- new icons for the newly added device, and related settings.\n-- Added a back button to go back to the device selection screen.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n\n---\n\n## How to use Blinkit\n\nTo use Blinkit, [download](https:\/\/github.com\/techtek\/BlinkitHive\/archive\/master.zip) the compressed files from [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/techtek\/BlinkitHive) and extract the content and put the Blinkit folder somewhere and run Blinkit.hta to start the interface.\n\n(Make sure the path to the Blinkit folder does not contain any spaces, because it will result in a error and the program will not function properly)\n\nWhen Blinkit is started you can press the edit buttons to set the Hive username you want to get notification on, you can set your own or someone else's username. And here you can set the light blink length, Hive Node and USB drive letter, where your USB flash drive is located at and that you want to blink. (or select another device to use.)\n\nAfter you have edited the settings you can press the purple Blinkit button located at the bottom of the mainscreen to test blink your device, and if it blinked you then can press the start button next to the function you want to start.\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n## Supported devices\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n**Flash Drives**\n\n\nAll USB flash drives are supported and any brand, you probably have one laying around, alternatively a USB Flash card reader can be used, or even a external HDD, but best are USB sticks, for example the Lexar S45 series have a very bright led light, and even some of the most common and inexpensive promotional USB drives have a bright LED light as well.\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n**Smarthome Devices**\n\nAll Smart home devices that can run Tasmota firmware. (Tasmota is a open source firmware for ESP8266 devices such as inexpensive wifi light bulbs and wifi power socket switches.) (as well as other devices that can be toggled by web requests)\n\n\n\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n## Technical details\n\nThis version of Blinkit is made for Windows 10 and uses batch scripts to interact with the hardware devices. HTA (HTML application) is used for the interface, this approach makes sure that the application will work without the use of heavy SDK's or compiled code. \n\nAll the scripts to interact with the devices, as well as the interface can be easily edited with just a text editor. and uses just HTML and CSS for the interface. \u00a0 \n\n<br><\/br>\n\n## Contributing\nContributing is made easy because the coding and project approach is kept easy and straightforward, If you are interested in contributing to the Blinkit project, please find me in the [Blinkit Discord server](https:\/\/discord.gg\/73h8XqP) or leave a message under this post.\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\nPlease report bugs you may encounter so that they can be fixed.\n\nFeedback is always very welcome, and

Notifications are triggered on new, and interactions with, the latest post in the selected Hive community.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YllbNpg.gif)\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IcN7q3y.png)\n*Blinkit blinking on GEMS community activity* \n\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n### Hive Nodes\n\n- Added a new setting and a button to make it possible to edit the Hive node that is used to get the Hive blockchain data from. The suggested nodes that are added, come from [these posts](https:\/\/hive.blog\/@fullnodeupdate) from @fullnodeupdate and are verified to have been accepting API requests. the default node that Blinkit uses is set to @roelandp his node:\n\nhttps:\/\/hive.roelandp.nl\n\nOther nodes you can choose to use:\n\nhttps:\/\/api.hive.blog @blocktrades\nhttps:\/\/api.pharesim.me @pharesim\nhttps:\/\/rpc.ausbit.dev @ausbitbank\nhttp:\/\/anyx.io @anyx\nhttps:\/\/api.hivekings.com @drakos\nhttps:\/\/techcoderx.com @techcoderx\nhttps:\/\/api.openhive.network @gtg\nhttps:\/\/rpc.esteem.app @esteemapp\n\nThe above witness nodes are accepting api requests, not every node is accepting these kind of API requests, therefore consider to vote for the above users if they are a witness because they are helping to make Hive more decentralised and make it possible to have apps like Blinkit. \n\n<br><\/br>\n\n### Interface\n\n- Interface updates: settings are now icons to save space on the main screen, an extra screen is added to house the community related functions.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n<br><\/br>\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZqP5AO4.png)\n\n*Settings are now icons, and a Hive node setting is added.*\n\n<br><\/br>\n\n\n## How to use\n\nTo use Blinkit, [download](https:\/\/github.com\/techtek\/BlinkitHive\/archive\/master.zip) the compressed files from [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/techtek\/BlinkitHive) and extract the content and put the Blinkit folder somewhere and run Blinkit.hta to start the interface.\n\n(Make sure the path to the Blinkit folder does not contain any spaces, because it will result in a error and the program will not function properly)\n\nWhen Blinkit is started you can press the edit buttons to set the Hive username you want to get notification on, you can set your own or someone else's username.
